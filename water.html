    <p>Fast facts on drinking water</p>
            <div class="fact">
                Adult humans are 60 percent water, and our blood is 90 percent water.
                There is no universally agreed quantity of water that must be consumed daily.
                Water is essential for the kidneys and other bodily functions.
                When dehydrated, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and wrinkling.
                Drinking water instead of soda can help with weight loss.

                <h3>Fifteen benefits of drinking water</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It forms saliva and mucus</li>
                            <b>Saliva helps us digest our food and 
                                keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. 
                                This prevents friction and damage. 
                                Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. 
                                Consumed instead of sweetened beverages,

                            <b>Blood is more than 90 percent water,
                                and blood carries oxygen to different
                                parts of the body.</b>

                                of the spine, contains around 80 percent water.
                                Long-term dehydration can reduce the joints’
                                shock-absorbing ability, leading to joint pain.</b>
                        <li>It regulates body temperature</li>
                            <b>Water that is stored in the middle layers of the 
                                skin comes to the skin’s surface as sweat when 
                                the body heats up. As it evaporates, 
                                it cools the body. In sport.</b>
                        <li>It boosts skin health and beauty</li>
                            <b>With dehydration, the skin can 
                                become more vulnerable to skin disorders

                                lead to problems with thinking and reasoning.</b>
                        <li>The digestive system depends on it</li>

                                Dehydration can lead to digestive problems, 
                                constipation, and an overly acidic stomach. 
                                This increases the risk of
