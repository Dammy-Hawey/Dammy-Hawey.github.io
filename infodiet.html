    Dieting is not bad if the purpose
    is well define.
    Many had taking dieting as a means
    to save resources and a way of 
    minimizing rate of expenditure--very
    wrong notion!

            <h2 id="1" style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT IS DIETING?</h2>
         <div class="font">
                    
                    <h5>Does the word "diet" immediately make 
        you think of an unpleasant weight-loss regimen?

        If it did, you are probably not alone. For example,
        consider the use of the term "diet" in marketing 
        food products—it usually describes 
        foods low in calories, such as diet soda.
        Dieting, regulating one’s food intake for the purpose 
        of improving one’s physical condition, especially for 
        the purpose of reducing obesity, or what is conceived 
        to be excess body fat. Dieting plans are based on the 
        reduction of any of the macronutrients 
        (fats, carbohydrates, and proteins) that constitute 
        the major portions of food that a person eats 
        (other than water) and that are necessary sources 
        of energy. Energy deficits of 500–1,000 calories per 
        day produce rather rapid initial weight loss owing to 
        the early loss of body water, especially if 
        carbohydrates are restricted. But, after the initial 
        effects of dehydration, all the dieting plans produce 
        a rate of fat loss that can only be proportional to 
        the caloric deficit.&nbsp;</h5>

        The following are some major approaches to dieting:
            <h5>(1) Controlled dieting such as that directed by weight-control
        clubs (e.g., Weight Watchers International, Inc.) and 
        health spas involves programs that include education on 
        nutrition, group reinforcement, specially constructed 
        diets that provide adequate amounts of nutrients, 
        and weight-maintenance regimens that are designed for 
        long-term use. Although long-term success rates are 
        difficult to determine, the dietary regimens are usually 
        well-designed and can be counted on to provide proper 
        nourishment even if weight loss is minimal.&nbsp;</h5>
            <h5>(2) The so-called “prudent diet” is designed to control 
        blood lipids and cholesterol for those persons at risk of 
        coronary artery diseases. The prudent diet and its relatives 
        stress a low-saturated and high-unsaturated fat content and 
        limited amounts of sugar; they restrict red meat and stress 
        poultry and nonoily fish.&nbsp;</h5>
            <h5>(3) “Formula diets,” such as Metrecal, Slender Now, 
        and the Cambridge Diet plan, provide for the intake 
        of a minimum of necessary nutrients—especially protein—in 
        liquid form. Many such plans are packaged with liquids or 
        powdered supplements, to be consumed variously from one to 
        four times a day; modified versions call for two liquid 
        meals and one meal of conventional food. The advantages 
        of such formulas are ritual and reduced decision making, 
        and the disadvantages are that dieters learn nothing about 
        eating habits because choices are made for them and, also, 
        that the more restrictive of these diets (down to 300 
        calories per day) can be quite dangerous to the health. 
        Restrictive plans should be undertaken with medical 
        supervision.&nbsp;</h5>
            <h5>(4) The low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and high-protein diets,
        which became rather popular from the early 1970s, restrict 
        sugars and starches to a minimum by stressing meats, 
        poultry, fish, and cheeses. The effect on the body is 
        to produce ketosis and dehydration; thus initial weight 
        loss may be marked. Although calories are not counted, 
        the usual caloric intake is reduced because most human 
        bodies are unable to adapt rapidly to the marked change 
        in dietary composition. Weight is lost quickly but is 
        returned as soon as normal eating habits are reestablished.
        The richness of the diet, in general, may produce 
        dangerous effects related to the excretion of large 
        amounts of uric acid and other nitrogenous end products 
        and to the high saturated-fat content of the diet.&nbsp;</h5>
           <h5> (5) High-carbohydrate, high-fibre diets promote the 
        consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains. 
        Dietary fibre is a general term for indigestible 
        carbohydrates that make up the cell walls of plants. 
        Such fibres, as bulking agents, may make dieters feel 
        satiated on food of fewer calories than normal.
        The best of the high-carbohydrate diets are moderate 
        in protein and low in fat and promise slow weight loss 
        with exercise and careful nutritional consideration.
        Some plans, however, are so low in calories or so low 
        in protein or fat as to be nutritionally unsound.</h5>

           <h5> (6) Diet aids—such as amphetamines,phenylpropanolamine(PPA),
        starch blockers, benzocaine, diuretics, and thyroid 
        hormones—come in pill form and are intended to suppress 
        the appetite or reduce stomach space. Many such aids—such 
        as amphetamines—have proved to be dangerous, whereas 
        others are simply ineffective. Over-the-counter 
        preparations such as PPA are ineffective in the dose 
        provided (25 mg), though promotion for the product 
        continues. The search continues for safe and effective 
        appetite suppressants and for hormonal agents that may 
        safely increase metabolic rate without inducing concomitant
        loss of lean body mass, including protein and bone.&nbsp;</h5>

            Most time to reduce OBESITY and regulate SUGAR intake.

        <div class="font">
            Once abnormality is detected and diagnosed by your Physician...
            Better still if you discover you are over weighing e.g.,
            weithg above 75-80kg.
