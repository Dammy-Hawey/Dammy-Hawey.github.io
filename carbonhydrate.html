    <h2>Here is Carbonhydrate as part of the classes of food!!</h2>
        <strong>
            Carbohydrates provide energy for our bodies to run on.
             When you eat a food that contains carbs, the carbs
              are broken down by the body into glucose.
               “Glucose is the primary fuel that circulates
                in our blood at all times. It’s also the principle
                 fuel for the brain,” says Dr. Katz.
            But you don’t eat “carbs” alone. You eat food.
                “One of the places people go wrong is thinking
                that carbohydrates are indicative of some particular
                    kind of food. 
                However, all plants are made up of carbohydrates,” says Katz. 
                These foods — whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fruits, dairy,
                       and vegetables — also contain essential nutrients,
                        like fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.
                “Since plant foods are always a carb source, you
                    cannot get any of those essential nutrients [from foods] 
                    without eating carbs. It’s valid to say then that carb foods 
                    are supporting almost every aspect of human physiology,” he adds.

                    Role of carbohydrates in health
                Carbohydrates are an important source of energy, 
                forming around 40% to 80% of our total energy intake. 
                Several health organizations recommend carbohydrates 
                should form the main source of energy over other food 
                groups for the following reasons:

                Carbohydrates provide easily available energy for 
                oxidative metabolism and energy production
                Carbohydrates help maintain a healthy blood sugar level
                Fibre is beneficial in maintaining normal and healthy 
                gastrointestinal function unlike fat and protein, a high 
                carbohydrate intake is not linked to adverse health effects, 
                providing the carbohydrates are derived form a variety of sources.
                Compared with diets rich in fat and protein, diets rich in 
                carbohydrates reduce the risk of obesity and its associated conditions.
                
                    Sources of carbohydrates
                Food sources that are rich in carbohydrates include cereals, 
                root crops or tubers, sugar, pulses and legumes, vegetables, 
                fruits and milk products. Grains and vegetables such as rice, 
                wheat, maize, barley, potatoes, yams, cassava, and sweet potatoes 
                are rich in starch.

                Nuts, legumes and high-fibre grain or whole grains contain significant 
                amounts of dietary fibre, about a third of which is present as hemicellulose. 
                Around one-fourth of the fibre in grains and fruits and one third in nuts and 
                vegetables is made up of cellulose. Pectin makes up about 15% to 20% of the 
                content in legumes, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Added sugar in the diet is 
                a small but important source of carbohydrates.
                 Food sources that contain added sugar include fruit drinks, biscuits and desserts.

                    Carbohydrate recommendations
                As per recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
                the intake of total carbohydrate should be enough to provide 55% to 75% 
                of the total energy requirement.
                 Proteins should provide 10% to 15% and fats should provide 15% to 30% 
                 of the total energy. This requirement can be met by consuming a daily minimum 
                 of 400 grams of vegetables and fruits including 30 grams of pulses, nuts and seeds.
