    <h2>Here is Vitamins as part of the classes of food!!</h2>
        <b>
            Vitamins are a group of substances that are needed for normal cell function, growth, and development.
            There are 13 essential vitamins. This means that these vitamins are required for the body to work properly. They are:

            <ul type="circle">
               <li> Vitamin A</li>

                <li>Folate (folic acid and B9)</li>
            </ul>
                <strong>
                    Vitamins are grouped into two categories:
                </strong>
                    <pre>
                    Fat-soluble vitamins: They are stored in 
                        the body's fatty tissue. The four fat-soluble
                        vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K.
                        These vitamins are absorbed more easily
                        by the body in the presence of dietary fat.
                    Water-soluble vitamins(there are 9 WSVs):
                        They are not stored in the body.
                        Any leftover water-soluble vitamins
                        leave the body through the urine.
                        Although, the body keeps a small
                        reserve of these vitamins,
                        they have to be taken on a regular
                        basis to prevent shortage in the body.
                        Vitamin B12 is the only water-soluble
                        vitamin that can be stored in the liver
                        for many years. Some “vitamin-like
                        factors” are also needed by the body such as:

                    ...Choline
                    ...Carnitine
                    </pre>

                            <td>Vitamin A</td>
                            <td>helps form and maintain healthy teeth, bones, soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin.</td>

                            <td>Vitamin B6</td>
                            <td>is also called pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 helps form red blood cells and maintain brain 
                                function. This vitamin also plays an important role in the proteins that are part of 
                                many chemical reactions in the body. The more protein you eat the more pyridoxine your body requires.</td>

                            <td>like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It also helps form red blood cells 
                                and maintain the central nervous system.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Vitamin C</td>
                            <td>also called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes healthy teeth and gums.
                                 It helps the body absorb iron and maintain healthy tissue. It is also essential for wound healing.</td>

                            <td>Vitamin D</td>
                            <td>is also known as the "sunshine vitamin," since it is made by the body after being in the sun.
                                 Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine 3 times a week is enough to produce the body's requirement of 
                                 vitamin D for most people at most latitudes. People who do not live in sunny places may not 
                                 make enough vitamin D. It is very hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone.
                                  Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. You need calcium for the normal development 
                                  and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain proper blood levels 
                                  of calcium and phosphorus.</td>

                            <td>Vitamin E</td>
                            <td> is an antioxidant also known as tocopherol. It helps the body form red blood cells and use vitamin K.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>7</td>
                            <td>Vitamin K</td>
                            <td>is needed because without it, blood would not stick together (coagulate).
                                 Some studies suggest that it is important for bone health.</td>

                            <td>Biotin</td>
                            <td>is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, 
                                and in the production of hormones and cholesterol.</td>

                            <td> is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves.
                                 It also has cholesterol-lowering effects at higher doses.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>10</td>
                            <td>Folate</td>
                            <td>works with vitamin B12 to help form red blood cells.
                                 It is needed for the production of DNA, which controls
                                  tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who is pregnant
                                   should be sure to get enough folate. Low levels of folate 
                                   are linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods 
                                   are now fortified with folic acid.</td>

                            <td> is essential for the metabolism of food.
                                 It also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol.</td>

                            <td>(vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins.
                                 It is important for body growth and the production of red blood cells.</td>

                            <td>(vitamin B1) helps the body cells change carbohydrates into energy.
                                 Getting enough carbohydrates is very important during pregnancy
                                 and breastfeeding. It is also essential for heart function and healthy nerve cells.</td>
